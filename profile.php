            	<h2>I'm fun to work with, I swear</h2>
            	<p>I’m Jay Manalansan, a web designer and web developer from the Art Institute of Orange County a college of Argosy University. I’m from Gardena, CA, and I’ve always been a creative person. I’m really into indie and electronic music. I grew up watching and reading Harry Potter and I will love it even after all this time. I like all things that are awesome. I have 3 dogs and let stray cats sleep around my house. I’m curious by nature and it fuels my growing insightfulness. I bring art and typography into all of my projects because it’s the simplest way to convey an experience; and I always want everyone to feel just as fun and clever as I do. </p>
                <h2>Feeling Sly Script</h2>
                <p>Sly script represents my identity as a web creator. Just like a fox I am clever, quick-thinking, and adaptable. Like a fox scanning its surroundings, I have the ability to research competitive companies and modern web design technologies. Like a fox hunting for food, I am great at problem solving front-end code and development. Like a fox meeting other animals, I am flexible and adaptable in my relationships with clients, bosses, and friends.  Fun, humorous, and maybe a tad bit mischievous, all of my abilities have helped me transcend into a great web designer. </p>

                <h2>What I look for</h2>
                <p>I am always looking for ways to strengthen and test my design capabilities. I find the best ways to grow are when you are working with teams, and you can have these immediate exchange of ideas and knowledge. I am a quick learner that pays very close attention to details and someday I want to let my natural born leader quality shine. </p>
